[{"content":"Description Leading the development of decentralized embedded systems for Autonomous Navigation Retrofit Kits in Ma- terial Handling Equipments, achieving a 30% reduction in wiring and hardware issues, simplifying installation. Achieved 60% increase in firmware response by employing a Test-Driven Development (TDD) lifecycle, design principles of event-driven state machines. Designed the modular hardware architecture incorporating CAN-based communication network for lateral control, longitudinal control, brake control and auxiliary control sub-modules of ANR Kits. Spearheading the collaboration with Godrej \u0026amp; Boyce Manufacturing Company Ltd. for implementation of autonomous embedded systems into the vehicle stock sysytem of their range of MHEs. Spearheading collaboration with International Tractors Ltd. for the implementation of autonomous embedded systems, overseeing navigational control and auxiliary control for their agricultural products.
