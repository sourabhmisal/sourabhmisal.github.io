      <description>Description Leading the development of decentralized embedded systems for Autonomous Navigation Retrofit Kits in Ma- terial Handling Equipments, achieving a 30% reduction in wiring and hardware issues, simplifying installation. Achieved 60% increase in firmware response by employing a Test-Driven Development (TDD) lifecycle, design principles of event-driven state machines. Designed the modular hardware architecture incorporating CAN-based communication network for lateral control, longitudinal control, brake control and auxiliary control sub-modules of ANR Kits.</description>
