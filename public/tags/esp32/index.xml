      <description>Description This was the final year project of the undergraduate course in electronics and communication engineering. Please find the full description in this Github Link :! This was also published as a research paper :- DOI: 10.1109/ICCMC48092.2020.ICCMC-00015 Hardware used are ESP32 Microcontrollers, Bluetooth Low Energy beacon Technology used is Message Queing Telemetry Transport Trilateration algorithm is made to run on the received RSSI values and position is determined. The firmware and the positioning algorithm were written on the C/C++ and ReactJS .</description>

      <description>Description This was a hobby project done for emulating mouse control using hand gestures. Please have a look at the link for seeing the project in action The motivation was to create a more seamless user experience for the human-computer interaction. The hand gestures were picked up by the MPU6050 IC which is a three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope Micro Electro-mechanical system (MEMS). Wrote and optimized firmware which provides spin capability for the robot.</description>

      <description>Description Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=eiIdjnngemfgRDL1&amp;amp;v=C3e-fgLwdl8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be Wrote and optimized firmware which provides spin capability for the robot. Learnt PCB Designing and optimized design of control board using EasyEDA and KiCad Debugging issues of the robot Worked on a feedback loop system using IR sensor for the robot. Worked on system to detect bounce using piezo-electric sensors. Learnt about improvements in designing the product and optimization of embedded software. </description>
