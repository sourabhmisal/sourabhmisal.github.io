      <description>Description This was the project done at my first internship after my undergraduate course in electronics and communication engineering. Please have a look at the project using this Link Wrote and optimized firmware which provides spin capability for the robot. Wrote and optimized firmware for motor control systems of various motors used, including BLDC, Stepper and Servo Motor. Learnt PCB Designing and optimized design of control board using EasyEDA and KiCad Worked on a feedback loop system using IR sensor for the robot.</description>
