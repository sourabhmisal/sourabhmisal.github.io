      <description>Description Developed an autonomous navigation kit for existing Battery-Operated Pallet Trucks (BOPTs) as part of Flux Auto&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive warehouse automation solution, following the guidelines of IEC 61508 which is Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems.&#xA;Key Technologies and Skills Communication Protocols :&#xA;CANopen Protocol : Integrated CANopen for robust communication among submodules of the modularized embedded system architecture. Developed custom CANopen nodes for various components, ensuring seamless interaction with the vehicle’s existing CAN bus and its subsystems and facilitating modular and scalable firmware architecture Embedded Communication Protocols : Developed low-level drivers for I2C, CAN, UART, and USB using HAL APIs and libraries provided by silicon vendors.</description>
