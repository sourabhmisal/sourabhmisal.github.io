I had done the simulation setup on gazebo for interfacing robot with different ROS packages, some of which are official ROS packages and others are packages that are created. The navigation of robot to specified pick-up and drop-off zones within the Gazebo world using localization is done using AMCL and trajectory planning through ROS Navigation stack, which relies on Dijkstra\u0026rsquo;s algorithm. The Navigation Goal Node is developed that facilitates the communication with the ROS Navigation stack, enabling the autonomous transmission of successive goals for the robot to achieve. A virtual model of Tutlebot3 was used as home service robot where the it navigates to pick up and deliver virtual objects (using markers). Shell scripts were written to execute home service simulation.
