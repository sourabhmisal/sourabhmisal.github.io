### Description
* This was the final year project of the undergraduate course in electronics and communication engineering. Please find the full description in this [**Github Link :**](https://github.com/sourabhmisal/Indoor_Positioning_Using_ESP32_MQTT_BLE)!
* This was also published as a research paper :- [**DOI: 10.1109/ICCMC48092.2020.ICCMC-00015**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9076468)
* Hardware used are ESP32 Microcontrollers, Bluetooth Low Energy beacon
* Technology used is Message Queing Telemetry Transport
* Trilateration algorithm is made to run on the received RSSI values and position is determined.
* The firmware and the positioning algorithm were written on the C/C++ and ReactJS .
