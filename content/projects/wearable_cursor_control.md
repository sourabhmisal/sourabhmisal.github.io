### Description
* This was a hobby project done for emulating mouse control using hand gestures. Please have a look at the [**link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=eiIdjnngemfgRDL1&v=C3e-fgLwdl8&feature=youtu.be) for seeing the project in action
* The motivation was to create a more seamless user experience for the human-computer interaction.
* The hand gestures were picked up by the MPU6050 IC which is a three-axis accelerometer and three-axis gyroscope Micro Electro-mechanical system (MEMS).
* Wrote and optimized firmware which provides spin capability for the robot.
* Learnt PCB Designing and optimized design of control board using EasyEDA and KiCad 
* Debugging issues of the robot 
* Worked on a feedback loop system using IR sensor for the robot. 
* Worked on system to detect bounce using piezo-electric sensors.
* Learnt about improvements in designing the product and optimization of embedded software.
