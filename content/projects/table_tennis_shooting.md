### Description
* This was the project done at my first internship after my undergraduate course in electronics and communication engineering. Please have a look at the project using this [**Link**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkQY86sJpRo&ab_channel=PongFoxTableTennisRobot)
* Wrote and optimized firmware which provides spin capability for the robot.
* Wrote and optimized firmware for motor control systems of various motors used, including BLDC, Stepper and Servo Motor.
* Learnt PCB Designing and optimized design of control board using EasyEDA and KiCad 
* Worked on a feedback loop system using IR sensor for the robot. 
* Worked on system to detect bounce using piezo-electric sensors.
* Learnt about improvements in designing the product and optimization of embedded software.
