### Description

* Developed a FreeRTOS firmware stack for SGP40, VEML7700, BME688 (via TCA6408), and BNO055 with PCF8523 RTC timestamping; executed full sensor-read + JSON logging every 3 s.

* Implemented a FATFS microSD SPI logger with robust append/seek, enabling 7+ days of uninterrupted capture on a 5000 mAh pack (~30 mA average draw).

### Description

* Built a custom Zephyr bootloader for nRF52840 with dual-slot image management and USB DFU, adding reset-aware logic to auto-switch between DFU and app execution.

* Wrote high-speed SPI drivers for ADC/DAC acquisition and impulse-signal processing, integrating simple digital logic ops for robust conditioning and safe firmware recovery workflows. -->
