### Description

- Leading the development of decentralized embedded systems for Autonomous Navigation Retrofit Kits in Ma-
terial Handling Equipments, achieving a 30% reduction in wiring and hardware issues, simplifying installation.
- Achieved 60% increase in firmware response by employing a Test-Driven Development (TDD) lifecycle,
design principles of event-driven state machines.
- Designed the modular hardware architecture incorporating CAN-based communication network for lateral
control, longitudinal control, brake control and auxiliary control sub-modules of ANR Kits.
- Spearheading the collaboration with Godrej & Boyce Manufacturing Company Ltd. for implementation of
autonomous embedded systems into the vehicle stock sysytem of their range of MHEs.
- Spearheading collaboration with International Tractors Ltd. for the implementation of autonomous embedded
systems, overseeing navigational control and auxiliary control for their agricultural products.
