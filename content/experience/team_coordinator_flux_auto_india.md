### Description

* Architected decentralized embedded hardware and firmware stacks for Autonomous Navigation Retrofit (ANR) Kits in Battery-Operated Pallet Trucks (BOPTs), Reach Trucks, and Tractors, enabling scalable deployment across multiple vehicle platforms.

* Led system integration of CAN-based communication networks for lateral, longitudinal, braking, and auxiliary control, streamlining cross-platform deployment and reducing wiring complexity by 30%, simplifying installation.

* Delivered event-driven, RTOS-based firmware stacks built on microkernel fusion and Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, boosting responsiveness by 60% and cutting command-to-response latency by 30 ms.

* Directed electrical and hardware architecture decisions, including microcontroller selection, schematic design, and PCB layouts, ensuring robust and modular embedded control modules for Autonomous Robotics Kits.

* Developed safety-critical emergency braking systems for BOPTs and Tractors, integrating linear actuators and 2D laser scanners (Hokuyo/SICK) to guarantee reliable obstacle detection and safe autonomous stops.

* Authored and optimized device drivers for key peripheral ICs including MCP23017 (GPIO Expander), PCA9685 (PWM Timer), DS3502 & MCP4441 (Digital Potentiometers), and INA230 (Power Sensing), broadening sensor/actuator interfacing capabilities.

* Executed Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and PCB-in-the-loop testing frameworks using VTD Simulator APIs, cutting validation cycles by 15% while ensuring robust simulation of autonomous vehicle dynamics.

* Researched and reverse-engineered vehicle platforms (EVs, Trucks, RTs, Tractors), analyzing vehicle dynamics, sensor stack placement, and communication protocols to optimize integration of ANR Kits.

* Coordinated and collaborated with cross-functional teams (mechanical, electrical, robotics software) and external partners to successfully integrate autonomous systems into commercial vehicle fleets.
