### Description

* Built a custom Zephyr bootloader for nRF52840 with dual-slot image management and USB DFU, adding reset-aware logic to auto-switch between DFU and app execution.

* Wrote high-speed SPI drivers for ADC/DAC acquisition and impulse-signal processing, integrating simple digital logic ops for robust conditioning and safe firmware recovery workflows.

Description

Architected a CANopen + FreeRTOS framework (with ROS integration) using a binary-search-optimized object dictionary; cut vehicle integration time by ~70% and improved responsiveness by ~30%.

Delivered event-driven firmware and motor/actuator control (PID/FOC) for longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics, reducing response latency by ~20–30 ms.

Directed electrical/hardware architecture (MCU selection, schematics, PCB layouts) for autonomous control modules and developed safety-critical braking with linear actuators + 2D lidars (Hokuyo/SICK).

Authored drivers for MCP23017, PCA9685, DS3502/MCP4441, and INA230; led reverse-engineering, vehicle ops, sensor placement, and HIL (VTD APIs), trimming validation cycles by ~15%.

Coordinated cross-functional integrations of Autonomous Navigation Kits across diverse vehicle platforms, improving system performance and reliability.
